Name: Alex Liang, Bill Chan

Bill:
- worked on implementing A*/Single-step pathing to entities
- mouse event that spawns the new mobile entity
- "world changing" event triggered by mouse click which modifies background image of affected tiles
- modifying textures/bmp files
- adding submarine which moves with arrow keys, press spacebar to drop a bacon entity that the turtle will eat

Alex:
- creating turtle class
- modifying octo class so that it changes into shark when passing through a cave
- spawning/changing cave background
- modifying textures/bmp files
- adding submarine which moves with arrow keys

1. When the user clicks on the screen, it spawns a cave background on the mouseclick (can repeat this action).
2. The click also spawns a turtle entity that eats bacon.
3. If an octopus enters the cave, it turns into a shark that swims faster and eats more fish.
4. Pressing arrow keys moves the submarine located at the top left corner.
