Name: Alex Liang, Bill Chan

Bill:
- worked on implementing A*/Single-step pathing to entities
- mouse event that spawns the new mobile entity
- "world changing" event triggered by mouse click which modifies background image of affected tiles

Alex:

1. When the user clicks on the screen, it spawns a cave background on the mouseclick (can repeat this action).
2. The click also spawns a turtle entity beside it where it eats bacon at a slower pace.
3. If an octopus enters the cave, it turns into a shark that swims faster and eats more fish.
